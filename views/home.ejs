  <h1>Timestamp microservice</h1>
    <p>When you pass a string as a parameter, it will check to see whether that string contains either a unix timestamp or a natural language date (example: January 1, 2016).</p>
    <p>If it does, it returns both the Unix timestamp and the natural language form of that date.</p>
    <p>If it does not contain a date or Unix timestamp, it returns null for those properties.</p>
